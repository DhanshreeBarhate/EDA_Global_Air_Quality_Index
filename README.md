# Global Air Quality Index Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Global Air Quality Index (AQI) dataset. The dataset provides information on air quality parameters such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) across different locations worldwide.


## Analysis
The exploratory data analysis covers the following aspects:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Statistical summary and distribution of air quality parameters.
- Temporal analysis to identify trends and seasonality.
- Spatial analysis to visualize air quality variations across different regions.
- Correlation analysis to explore relationships between different pollutants.
- Insights and observations drawn from the analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn


## Acknowledgements
- The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle.
- Acknowledge any other relevant data sources or inspirations.
